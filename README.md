# FAST-LIO Modular (ROS2)

A modular, modern C++ refactoring of [FAST-LIO](https://github.com/hku-mars/FAST_LIO) for ROS2.

## 🎯 Project Status

⚠️ **Under Development**: This is an active refactoring project. Use the original FAST-LIO for production.

## 📊 Base Version

This project is based on:

- **Original Algorithm**: [FAST-LIO](https://github.com/hku-mars/FAST_LIO) by HKU-MARS Lab
- **ROS2 Port**: [Erratic-Robotics/FAST_LIO](https://github.com/Erratic-Robotics/FAST_LIO)
- **License**: GPL-2.0 (maintained from original)

## 🚀 Planned Improvements

- [ ] Modular architecture
- [ ] Modern C++ (C++17/20)
- [ ] Comprehensive tests
- [ ] Thread-safe design
- [ ] Better configuration management
- [ ] Improved documentation
